#### **Telemetry Data**

Bit SMTP uses [wp-telemetry](https://packagist.org/packages/bitapps/wp-telemetry) to collect some telemetry data upon the user’s confirmation. This helps us to troubleshoot problems faster & make product improvements.

Wp-Telemetry DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY start gathering data; rather, it will gather basic telemetry data when a user allows it. We collect the data to ensure a great user experience for all our users.
